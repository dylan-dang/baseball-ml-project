    "In this project, we want to predict wether or not a given baseball pitch will be a home run or not. This is an interesting problem because it could be used to better predict the outcomes of baseball games in advance (at least in terms of number of homeruns). Alternatively, one can calculate the probability of a given pitch being a home run *during* the pitch itself (though the outcome will be evident seconds after).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we are using data from the UT Baseball 2024 Season. Our dataset contains data from every single pitch during UT home games, taken from a TrackMan brand detection machine which tracks and records 3D characteristic of a baseball in motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use this data to predict whether a given pitch will be a home run or not. We will use information such as the pitch velocities, runs scored, and other pitch information to predict this. This ML problem is especially interesting, as it suffers from a massive imbalance of classes - far more of the pitches are NOT homeruns, compared to those that are. (Reminiscent of the \"predicting credit card fraud\" problem). This means that our data will have to be carefully pruned and our modeling techniques must be jucicious to avoid a too-high false negative rate.\n",

    "While it may be tempting to immediately remove features such as the inning number, we need to do some critical thinking. The only rows which we should drop outright are those which are either too difficult to process or too variant to be meaningful. For example, pitcher name (which is categorical), and the timestamp are 2 good examples of columns we should just drop. However, info like the inning number is useful and may in fact have a correlation with home runs which should not be glossed over. For example, perhaps pitchers tend to get tired by the 9th inning, and thus give up more home runs. Or alternatively, they \"lock in\" in the final inning to close out a tight game! We don't really know, so it behooves us to keep it in and let analytics to the thinking.\n",
